# Copy with QR Code

## Introduction

This project was created to solve a common problem: copying text from one device to another. Often, users face difficulties when they want to transfer text between devices, especially when they are not connected to the same network or when traditional methods like email or messaging apps are not convenient. This application provides a simple solution by generating a QR code for the text, which can then be scanned by another device to retrieve the text.

## Features
